          Flow is a course planning website for University of Waterloo students.
          You can find everything from courses and professors to prerequisites
          here.
          <br />
          <br />
          Our mission is simple: to empower UWaterloo students through
          uncensored and unfiltered course and professor reviews.
          <br />
          <br />
          Had a bad prof? We want to know. Had a great one? Tell us as well.
          Found a course completely and utterly useless? Leave a review. Your
          experiences help us help more than 30,000 students like you every
          month choose great courses and avoid not so great ones.

        <PageBodyHeader>Our History</PageBodyHeader>
        <PageBodyParagraph>
          UW Flow started off as a Final Year Design Project built by four
          students in Software Engineering at UWaterloo. You can find our
          founders below. Launching Flow in 2012, they addressed a real need at
          the University: students did not have nearly enough information about
          courses to choose them. Here&apos;s Sandy Wu (one of our founders) on
          selecting courses before Flow:
          <br />
          <br />
          <b>
            &quot;It&apos;s like doing taxes. Each time, it&apos;s inevitable,
            and each time, it&apos;s a pain. Right now, students use the
            undergraduate calendar to look through thousands of courses before
            even knowing what&apos;s out there. And that doesn&apos;t even
            include opinions from people who had taken those courses before. For
            that, we rely on friends and word of mouth. But that&apos;s both
            incomplete and inconvenient.&quot;

          We built UW Flow 2.0 in 2019 to modernize and hone in on functionality
          you care about. As you navigate UW Flow 2.0, you&apos;ll notice new
          features, better response times, and plenty more. What hasn&apos;t
          changed is our commitment to the UWaterloo community and our drive to
          empower you.

            He has worked at Uber ATG and SideFX and is interested in computer

            Dmytro likes precisely those things which are meticulously studied
            and well-understood. For that reason he doubts he will be a very
            good researcher. When this saddens him too much, he makes things go
            fast and is content.

            Over the course of building Flow 2.0, Max has concluded that
            frontend involves a lot more than just agonizing over CSS. That
            isn&apos;t to say he hasn&apos;t done that though. Not at all...
